                <p>
                    I am a web developer.<br>
                    My friends thinks I write magic.<br>
                    My family thinks I make magic.<br>
                    But I write code.<br>
                    Code that makes the internet work.<br>
                    I have passion and find enjoyment building designing website.<br>
                    Problem solving is my strong suite. Tough problems require a series of small solutions to make a
                    great solution.<br>
                    I have experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Angular 1.X, UI Design and Web Services.
                    With my problem solving skills comes an excitement for learning new technologies. My current fascination
                    is we web frameworks such as AngularJS and ReactJS. I am always looking to advance my knowledge,
                    though many outlets through free classes online, or watching lectures;
