    "aboutMe": "I am currently a freelance front-end web developer. After writing my first line of HTML and getting 'HELLO WORLD' on the screen I was hooked. I continued to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript writing basic websites to more advanced single pages app. I still have that passion for turning words on the screen on masterpieces on the screen. After building a basic personal website. I have rewritten it multiple times, making it more modern and adding more technology. My most recent project was taking static designs from a designer and converting it to a WordPress template using VueJS and the WordPress API. I am currently looking for a job as front-end web developer interested in challenges. If you have a challenge for me to tackle contact me at adunham95@gmail.com",
