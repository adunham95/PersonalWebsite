Run `ng serve` to serve localhost:4200

## Test Production builds

Run `ng build --prod`
After the projects builds run `npm run static-serve` 

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
